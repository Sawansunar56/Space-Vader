# My First Game on Python

This is the very first game that I have ever made on Python.

It is made with the framework pygame, a popular graphics making framework from python, So I did this game with the help of a tutorial.

The game itself is really simple, two spaceships are in the screen and both of them are controlled by a user and the the one who gets hit by the laser of the other will have their health reduced by one, for which there are 10 for each player.

The person whose health reaches 0 first will lose. 

So Yeah, that is my first game on python.
